In this repository the following scripts and data is deposited:

A) Cosolvent_apo
Structure filed (PDB format) and probe densities (CCP4 format) dervied from cosolvent apo simulations. Can be opened with PyMol.

B) Cosolvent_holo
Structure filed (PDB format) and probe densities (CCP4 format) dervied from cosolvent holo simulations.  Can be opened with PyMol.

C) Crystal_Water
Structure files with conserved water molecules determined by the analysis of PDB structures. Can be opened with PyMol.

D) Python_scripts
In-house python routines used to derive the data. "Readme" files explain on how to use the scripts.

E) WATsite_waters
Positions of water molecules derived from WATsite simulations. Can be opened with PyMol.
